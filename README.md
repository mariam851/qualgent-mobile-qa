# Decision Memo: Agent Framework Choice

For the Mobile QA Multi-Agent System, I chose Gemini LLM as the agent framework. 
It provides effective reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, which are suitable 
for orchestrating the Supervisor-Planner-Executor architecture. The framework also 
supports text-based instructions and integration with external tools like adb for 
interacting with Android apps.
